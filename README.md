## Game Overview

In _Flappy Teachers_, players control the teacher by pressing the space bar or the arrow up key to make him jump up and fly. The objective is to fly between columns of green pipes without colliding with them. As you pass through each set of pipes, sounds play to enhance the experience, and the game becomes progressively more challenging.

## Features

- **Character Selection:** Choose from three different characters to play as. Each character has a unique look and personality, adding variety to your gaming experience.
- **Scoring System:** Scores are awarded for each pipe the teacher successfully navigates through. Your score is prominently displayed in the top-left corner of the screen.
- **Sound Effects:** Distinctive sounds are triggered as the teacher passes through the pipes and if he happens to hit an obstacle.
